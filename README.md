This is a simple 2D RPG-style game built in Java. The player can move in four directions using keyboard input. The character changes animations based on movement and direction, and displays a standing animation when idle. The game features a static background image and uses a tile-based visual style. Currently, there are no enemies, interactions, or maps beyond the initial screen â€” it serves as a foundation for future gameplay features.
