========WORK IN PROGRESS========

This is a simple 2D RPG-style game built in Java. The player can move in four directions using keyboard input. The character changes animations based on movement and direction, and displays a standing animation when idle. The game features a static background image and uses a tile-based visual style. Currently, there are no enemies, interactions, or maps beyond the initial screen.

Download the .jar file to test the game.
